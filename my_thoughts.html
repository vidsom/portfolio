<p class="center_align small_text cool_font white_text">I never imagined that Scratch would be challenging. <br><br/> The projects we did required innovation. <br><br/> It was a really good way to be introduced to coding. <br><br/> I am really glad we started with Scratch. <br><br/> My frustration with the projects was very common. <br><br/> It was a good opportunity to collaborate with my peers. <br><br/> It was a very hands-on way of learning.</p>
<br><br/>
<h3 class="center_align large_text cool_font white_text" id="python">Python</h3>
<p class="center_align small_text cool_font white_text">A lot of the projects were frustrating.<br><br/> But this time I used my frustration to try harder. <br><br/> A lot of times, even the smallest mistakes were causing errors. <br><br/> I really challenged myself to think outside the box. <br><br/></p>
